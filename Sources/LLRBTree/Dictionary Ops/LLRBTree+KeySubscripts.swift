    /// The setter of this subscript will invalidate indices of the tree previously stored.
    ///
    /// The following example creates a new tree and prints the value of a
    /// key found in the tree (`"Coral"`) and a key not found in the
    /// tree (`"Cerise"`).
    ///
    ///     var hues: LLRBTree<String, Int> = ["Heliotrope": 296, "Coral": 16, "Aquamarine": 156]

    ///     // Prints "Optional(16)"
    ///     print(hues["Cerise"])

    ///
    /// When you assign a value for a key and that key already exists, the
    /// tree overwrites the existing value. If the tree doesn't
    /// contain the key, the key and value are added as a new key-value pair.
    ///
    /// Here, the value for the key `"Coral"` is updated from `16` to `18` and a
    /// new key-value pair is added for the key `"Cerise"`.

    ///     hues["Coral"] = 18

    ///
    ///     hues["Cerise"] = 330
    ///     print(hues["Cerise"])
    ///     // Prints "Optional(330)"
    ///
    /// If you assign `nil` as the value for the given key, the tree
    /// removes that key and its associated value.
    ///
    /// In the following example, the key-value pair for the key `"Aquamarine"`
    /// is removed from the tree by assigning `nil` to the key-based
    /// subscript.

    ///     let message = "Hello, Elle!"
    ///     var letterCounts: LLRBTree<Character, Int> = [:]

    /// When `letterCounts[letter, defaultValue: 0] += 1` is executed with a

    /// specified default value (`0`) is returned from the subscript,
    /// incremented, and then added to the tree under that key.
    ///
    /// - Note: Do not use this subscript to modify tree values if the
    ///   tree's `Value` type is a class. In that case, the default value
    ///   and key are not written back to the tree after an operation.
